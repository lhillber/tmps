# Thermo-magnetic Particle Simulator (TMPS)
TMPS enables the dynamical simulation of up tp `Natom=1e5` classical particles
with mass `m`, magnetic moment `mu`, and temperature `T` interacting with a time
dependent magnetic field. The gradient of the normal of the magnetic field
configuration must have a seperable time dependence.
