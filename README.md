# Thermo-magnetic Particle Simulator (TMPS)
TMPS enables the dynamical simulation of up to `Natom=1e5` noninteracting 
classical particles with mass `m`, magnetic moment `mu`, and 
temperature `T` driven by a time dependent magnetic field. The gradient of 
the normal of the magnetic field must have a seperable time dependence.
